// Build a function that a new customer will use when entering the deli.
// The function, takeANumber, should accept two parameters:
// the current line of people, along with the new person's name.
// The function should return a welcome message including the new person's position in line,
// such as "Welcome, Ada. You are number 1 in line.". And don't go being too programmer-y and give them their index.
// These are normal people. If they are 7th in line, tell them that.
// Don't get their hopes up by telling them they are number 6 in line.
